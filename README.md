Minidex is a fast, lightweight index for filesystem entries meant to be
embedded in desktop applications.

## Overview

Minidex implements a Log-Structured Merge-tree with Finite
State Transducers and an Inverted Index to efficiently store and serve
filesystem data (file paths, names and metadata) and provide instant
multi-word search with a small disk footprint.

Minidex offers support for offset+limit pagination, a Write-Ahead Log
for real-time insertion and background compaction of segments.

## Note
Minidex does _not_ implement the filesystem indexing process itself
(see `examples/fs-index`) on how to implement a basic indexer.
